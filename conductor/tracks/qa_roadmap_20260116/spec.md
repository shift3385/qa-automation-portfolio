# Specification: Phase 1 - Foundation & Playwright Core

## Overview
This track initiates the 3-month intensive QA study by establishing a professional-grade automation framework. We will focus on the E-Commerce domain and use Playwright with TypeScript as our primary engine.

## Objectives
- Set up a robust project structure following modern QA architecture (POM).
- Implement core user journeys for an e-commerce site (Login, Search, Add to Cart).
- Integrate initial QA theory (Test Design and Management) into the practical workflow.
- Establish CI/CD basics with GitHub Actions.

## Requirements
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better IDE support.
- Implement the Page Object Model (POM) pattern.
- Integrate a reporting tool (e.g., Playwright's built-in HTML reporter).
- Maintain 80% code coverage for utility/helper functions.

## Deliverables
- Fully functional automation repository.
- Initial Test Suite for E-Commerce core flows.
- GitHub Actions pipeline for automated execution on push.
- Study notes on ISTQB Test Design Techniques.
