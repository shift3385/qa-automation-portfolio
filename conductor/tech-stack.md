# Technology Stack

## Primary Programming Languages
- **JavaScript / TypeScript:** Primary focus for modern web automation (Playwright, Cypress).
- **Python:** Secondary focus for scripting, API testing (Requests), and versatile automation.
- *Note: Java is acknowledged as a future target but not prioritized for the initial 3-month intensive phase.*

## UI Automation Frameworks
- **Playwright (TypeScript/Python):** Main tool for high-performance, modern web testing.
- **Cypress (JavaScript/TypeScript):** For web-centric applications and developer-friendly testing.
- **Selenium WebDriver (Python/Java):** To ensure compatibility with established/legacy enterprise requirements.

## API & Service Testing
- **Playwright API + Supertest (Node.js):** Integrated UI/API testing suites.
- **Requests + Pytest (Python):** Industry-standard Pythonic approach to API validation.
- **Postman / Newman:** For exploratory testing and CLI-based collection execution.

## CI/CD & DevOps Platform Study
- **GitHub Actions:** Primary platform for portfolio projects and modern workflows.
- **GitLab CI:** Targeted study to meet enterprise requirements (as seen in Scanntech).
- **Azure DevOps:** To round out the "Big Three" cloud-native CI/CD environments.

## Management & Productivity
- **Jira:** For defect tracking and test management simulation.
- **Docker:** For containerized test execution environments.
- **Git:** Version control and collaboration.
