# Product Guidelines

## Study Methodology: Hybrid Senior Upskilling
This project follows a dual-track methodology designed specifically for a Senior Software Developer transitioning to Senior QA Automation:

1.  **Project-Based Learning (PBL):** The primary focus is the hands-on construction of a production-ready, multi-layer automation framework. This leverages existing architectural knowledge to master QA tools (Playwright, Cypress, RestAssured) by solving real-world implementation challenges.
2.  **Cert-Ready Theoretical Foundation:** Parallel to the practical work, the study plan incorporates ISTQB (Foundation and Advanced) syllabi. This ensures that formal QA terminology, defect management theory, and quality metrics are mastered to the level required for high-stakes corporate interviews.

## Documentation & Communication Standard
-   **Internal Notes & Study Summaries:** Spanish (for rapid comprehension and deep conceptual learning).
-   **Technical Artifacts:** English (Code, Comments, Commit Messages, Bug Reports, and Test Plans).
-   **Rationale:** This hybrid approach ensures maximum learning speed while maintaining the professional standards of the international tech market.

## Code Quality Standards for QA
-   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Applied strictly to test data and utility functions.
-   **POM/Screenplay Patterns:** Mandatory for Web UI automation to ensure maintainability.
-   **Atomic Tests:** Tests must be independent and capable of running in parallel.
-   **Meaningful Assertions:** Assertions must provide clear error messages that facilitate rapid debugging.
